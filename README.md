# Welcome!

This is my web site playground.

Right now, I am preparing to teach a workshop about using GitHub Pages. I love the ease with which GitHub makes publishing a personal web site. New to web programming? This is a great way to learn and try out new ideas! Not new to coding? While you cannot build a dynamic website to build your empire, GitHub Pages is a great place to share what you are learning with the world. It can also serve as your online resume and portfolio!

I am beginning my transition from software developer to application security tester. I am very excited about this change and look forward to sharing what I learn with the world!
